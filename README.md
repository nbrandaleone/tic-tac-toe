# tic-tac-toe

Implementation of tic-tac-toe (first Clojure project). It is human
vs the computer, and the computer determines its move based on the
minimax algorithm. You shouldn't be able to beat the computer - 
if you can, something's wrong so please let me know.

See /src/tic-tac-toe/core.clj for more comments.
